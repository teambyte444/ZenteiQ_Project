# ZenteiQ_Project(Student-Dropout-Prediction)

The goal of the project is to identify students at risk of dropping out the school.

# Introduction

We Collected data from a kaggle,cleaned and preprocessed the data by removing missing values, duplicates, and outliers.Selected the most relevant features that are likely to have a significant impact on predicting dropout rates or academic success.Choosen an appropriate machine learning algorithm to build the predictive model.We implemented in our project is XGBoost model.Trained the model using the training data set and validate its performance using the validation data set.Fine-tuned the model by adjusting its hyperparameters to improve its performance.Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.Deployed the model in a production environment, where it can be used to predict student dropout rates or academic success and provide the targeted interventions and supports.

We tired to develop simple student-dropout-prediction web application using streamlit framework.
